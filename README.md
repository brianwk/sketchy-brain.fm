# Brain.fm Timer â†’ sketchybar (macOS)

Creates a Sketchybar item that displays the Brain.fm timer in SketchyBar. I hope someone finds it useful.

## Why?
I created this script because SketchyBar alias didn't work well for a timer.

## Install

Python 3.9+

```bash
# Create a venv if desired
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

brew install sketchybar # if not already installed
```

## Files

- `test_brain.py`: CDP-only script that polls the DOM and updates sketchybar.
- `requirements.txt`: Python deps (CDP only).

## Usage

### Run the timer updater

```bash
python test_brain.py
```

You must have the Brain.fm application installed obviously. This will automatically run the program with the DevTools running on port 9222.
